Connect four is a strategy board game where the player who aligns four disks wins. 
Program has two main components: (1) the search algorithm, and (2) the evaluation function. The evaluation function quantifies how desired or undesired a state of the board is for the agent. The search algorithm helps the agent decided on the next move by efficiently exploring what might be the consequences of each move. 

This program implements the Minmax algorithm with Alpha Beta pruning.
